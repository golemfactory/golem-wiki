?> Golem is a decentralized marketplace for computing power. It enables CPUs and GPUs to connect in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application owners and individual users ("requestors") to rent resources from other users’ ("providers") machines. These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity.
Nowadays, centralized cloud providers are in control of these services, these platforms are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Golem proposes an open-source, decentralized and user controlled alternative.

One core component to Golem’s built-in feature set is an [**Ethereum-based transaction system**](/About/Payments), which enables direct payments between requestors, providers, and software developers.

### gWASM

?> Any code that can be compiled to WASM, can be distributed on Golem Network. gWASM allows you to run WebAssembly binaries on providers’ machines by turning WASM into a container for server-side parallel computations.

* [Quick start - testing gWASM locally](Products/gWASM/Quick-start)
* [gwasm-runner](Products/gWASM/gWASM-applications?id=gwasm-runner) is a project with a single goal: making developing new gWASM apps as simple as possible
* Learn how to [Create gWASM tasks in Golem](Products/gWASM/gWASM-tasks)
* Learn [how to build gWASM application](Products/gWASM/Building-gWASM-applications)
* Check our [sample application - g-flite](Products/gWASM/Sample-application) as a reference of your own app if you are a Developer. It is also **the simplest way to play around with gWASM if you are not a developer**

### task API

The Task API is a python library containing a programming interface and utility functions. When using this library for their project, developers can build apps and have them easily run on Golem.

* Check our [Task API documentation](https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/)
