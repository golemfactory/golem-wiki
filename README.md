?> Golem is a decentralized computation network, a way of distributing redundant computing power to those who are in need of it, on-demand. It creates a peer-to-peer network where users run a node to buy and/or sell computation. An individual node will either act as a requestor, computing tasks with the use of the network's resources. Or the node will be a provider, selling idle computational resources to the requestors. Together they form the peer-to-peer marketplace known as the Golem Network. We provide the default implementation of such a node in the form of the Golem daemon, called Yagna.

>[!WARNING|style:callout]
Golem Project is work in progress. The current version is a Beta stage -  named Clay Golem Beta - and it's not fully secure. 
>Check [this list of issues](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/labels/security) for more details. 
>Make sure to understand all risks before installing the software.

### gWASM

!> **WARNING:** Clay Golem is no longer supported. To read the documentation for the New Network (Yagna), please head to the [Golem SDK documentation](https://handbook.golem.network)

?> Any code that can be compiled to WASM, can be distributed on Golem Network. gWASM allows you to run WebAssembly binaries on providersâ€™ machines by turning WASM into a container for server-side parallel computations.

* [Quick start - testing gWASM locally](Products/gWASM/Quick-start)
* [gwasm-runner](Products/gWASM/gWASM-applications?id=gwasm-runner) is a project with a single goal: making developing new gWASM apps as simple as possible
* Learn how to [Create gWASM tasks in Golem](Products/gWASM/gWASM-tasks)
* Learn [how to build gWASM application](Products/gWASM/Building-gWASM-applications)
* Check our [sample application - g-flite](Products/gWASM/Sample-application) as a reference of your own app if you are a Developer. It is also **the simplest way to play around with gWASM if you are not a developer**

### task API

!> **WARNING:** Clay Golem is no longer supported. To read the documentation for the New Network (Yagna), please head to the [Golem SDK documentation](https://handbook.golem.network)

The Task API is a python library containing a programming interface and utility functions. When using this library for their project, developers can build apps and have them easily run on Golem.

* Check our [Task API documentation](https://taskapi.docs.golem.network/)
